
### Project Overview
**My Online Judge System** is a platform designed to help users enhance their Java programming skills through a series of structured quizzes. The system features four quizzes, each containing four questions. Users must achieve a 100% pass rate to earn a certification, motivating them to master the material thoroughly.

### Design Process
The design process focuses on creating a user-friendly platform for individuals aiming to improve their coding skills. The website caters to both regular users and members, offering free quizzes and the ability to submit programming solutions and interview questions. If users encounter issues, they can consult expert coders by clicking the "Ask an Expert" button. Membership unlocks access to exclusive online teaching sessions conducted by instructors.

### User Stories
**As a user**, I want to solve programming problems so that I can improve my coding skills.
**As a member**, I want to access exclusive teaching sessions so that I can learn from experts.
**As a user**, I want to submit my programming solutions so that I can receive feedback.
**As a user**, I want to find the institute's location so that I can visit it if needed.
**As a user**, I want to fill out a feedback form so that I can provide my opinions on the platform.

### Features
**User Registration**: Allows users to register and store their information locally.
**Certification Display**: Shows certificates to users who complete all quizzes.
**Certification Name Display**: Generate Username on certificate after user finished registration.
**Quiz Retake**: Users can retake quizzes if they answer incorrectly.
**Location Search**: Users can use goole map to search for the institute's location(assume i have).
**Feedback Form**: Users can fill out a form to provide feedback.
**Password Validation**: Prompts users to enter the correct password or register if they haven't.

### Technologies Used
CSS , HTML , JAVASCRIPT


### Features Left to Implement

Filtering:

Difficulty Levels: Allow users to filter quizzes by difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
Topic-Based Filtering: Enable users to filter quizzes based on specific topics or categories (e.g., arrays, strings, algorithms).
Save Highest Scores:

Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to display the highest scores of users.
Personal Best: Show users their personal best scores for each quiz.
Explanation of Wrong Answers:

Detailed Feedback: Provide detailed explanations for why an answer is incorrect and what the correct answer is.
Hints: Offer hints for each question to guide users towards the correct answer.
Time Limitation:

Timed Quizzes: Introduce time limits for quizzes to add a level of challenge.
Countdown Timer: Display a countdown timer during quizzes to keep users aware of the remaining time.
Membership Differentiation:

Exclusive Content: Offer exclusive quizzes and resources for members.
Priority Support: Provide priority support and access to expert coders for members.
Progress Tracking: Allow members to track their progress over time with detailed analytics.
Additional Quiz Improvements:

Randomized Questions: Randomize the order of questions in each quiz to prevent memorization.
Practice Mode: Introduce a practice mode where users can attempt questions without affecting their scores.
Daily Challenges: Offer daily challenges to keep users engaged and motivated.
Achievements and Badges: Implement a system of achievements and badges to reward users for their progress and milestones.

Collaborative Coding:

Enable users to collaborate on coding problems in real-time.
Implement pair programming features where two users can work on the same code simultaneously.

### Cross-Browser and Responsive Design
The project is designed to work seamlessly across different browsers and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### Bugs and Issues
During testing, some interesting bugs were discovered, such as:
- **Password Validation**: Incorrect password prompts and registration reminders.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the layout works on various screen sizes.

Feel free to adjust or expand on any of these sections to better fit your project's specifics! If you need further assistance, just let me know.
